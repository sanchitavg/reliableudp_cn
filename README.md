# Reliable UDP File Transfer

A Python project that implements a reliable file transfer system over UDP, with features like resume support, integrity checking, and efficient data transmission.

## Overview

UDP is fast but unreliable (no guarantee of delivery or order).
This project builds a custom reliability layer to ensure correct and complete file transfer.

## Features

* Chunk-Based Transfer – File split into 1024-byte chunks
* Resume Support – Continues from last received chunk using `progress.txt`
* Integrity Check – SHA-256 hash verifies file correctness
* Efficient Transfer – Selective Repeat with sliding window
